# Forest Fire Detection

This project is focused on detecting forest fires using machine learning techniques based on environmental data. It is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook and designed for data analysis, model training, and evaluation.

## 📌 Overview

The notebook demonstrates how to:

- Load and explore a dataset related to forest fires
- Perform data preprocessing and visualization
- Train machine learning models
- Evaluate performance using classification metrics

This project can serve as a starting point for building a forest fire prediction system or studying environmental risk modeling.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used contains features such as:

- Temperature
- Relative humidity
- Wind speed
- Rain
- Fire occurrence flag (binary classification target)

Ensure the dataset is placed in the correct directory as referenced in the notebook. If the notebook requires a file like `forestfires.csv`, make sure it's present in the working directory.

## 🛠 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/forest-fire-detection.git
   cd forest-fire-detection
2. Install the required Python packages:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Launch the notebook:
   jupyter notebook

🧪 Requirements
Create a requirements.txt with the following (already included if you use this repo):

numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
jupyter

📊 Machine Learning Models
The notebook may include the following models:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Model selection is based on evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

📈 Results
The notebook displays:

Confusion matrix

Classification report

Feature importance

Accuracy comparisons

These help assess which model performs best on the task of forest fire detection.
